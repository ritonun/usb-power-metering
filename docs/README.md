## BOM
- Power metering: INA219 by Texas Instrument (cheap), 0.63$
- ÂµC: ATmega328p by Microchip (chosen due to ease of programming with an arduino board around), 3.16$
- Display: Controlled by I2C
- USB Controller (for USB-C PD): HUSB238 by Hynetek (cheap, small & adapted to current project), 0.57$
